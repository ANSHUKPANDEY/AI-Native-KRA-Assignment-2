ANSHUKPANDEY: You are an expert sotware engineer with expertise in creating a three tier web application. 

GitHub Copilot: Thank you for sharing your expertise and project context. Your workspace is structured for a three-tier web application, with a frontend (React), backend (Python/FastAPI), and a db folder for database schema.

If you need help with any specific aspect—such as connecting the frontend to the backend, setting up API endpoints, database integration, Docker orchestration, or testing—please specify your request or the feature you want to implement. I’m ready to assist with any coding, configuration, or architectural tasks for your three-tier web app.

ANSHUKPANDEY: Please create a three-tier application using the back end, front-end and database end codes present in this repository.
You can use the information given in docs folder. 
Note: The application has to be dockerized and should be started using docker compose file.

GitHub Copilot: To create a fully dockerized three-tier application using your existing backend, frontend, and database code, I will:

1. Review the backend, frontend, and database setup.s
2. Check the docker-compose.yml and Dockerfiles for proper service definitions and networking.
3. Ensure environment variables and connections are set up between tiers.
4. Reference the docs for any specific requirements.
5. Make necessary updates so the app can be started with `docker compose up`.

Let me begin by reviewing your docker-compose.yml, backend and frontend Dockerfiles, and the docs for build/run instructions and requirements. Here’s a summary of your current setup:

- **docker-compose.yml**: Defines three services—db (Postgres), backend (FastAPI), and frontend (React). Networking and environment variables are set up correctly. The database schema is initialized from init.sql.
- **Backend Dockerfile**: Installs dependencies, copies the app, and runs FastAPI with Uvicorn.
- **Frontend Dockerfile**: Installs dependencies, copies source/public folders, and runs the React app.
- **Docs**: Build instructions and requirements confirm the three-tier architecture and describe the expected dashboard features.

Your repository is already structured for a three-tier, dockerized application. To start the app:
1. Run:  
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```
2. Access:
   - Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - Backend: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

If you need further integration (e.g., connecting frontend to backend, real-time metrics, or alerting), or want me to verify/modify code for any tier, let me know the specific feature or integration you want to implement or test next.

ANSHUKPANDEY: Run below mentioned command to create the three-tier application:
"docker compose up --build"

GitHub Copilot: The build failed because the Dockerfile for the frontend is trying to copy public and src using paths relative to the build context, but the context is already set to frontend. The correct paths should be `public` and `src` (not public and src).

I will update your Dockerfile to fix the copy commands so the build can proceed. 
```


Made changes.


```
The build failed because `package-lock.json` is missing in the frontend directory. This file is referenced in the Dockerfile but does not exist, causing the build to stop.

To resolve this, you can:
- Add a `package-lock.json` to the frontend directory (recommended for reproducible builds).
- Or, update the Dockerfile to skip copying `package-lock.json` if you do not use it.

Would you like me to update the Dockerfile to remove the `package-lock.json` line, or do you want to add the file?

ANSHUKPANDEY: Remove the package-lock.json

GitHub Copilot: 
```


Made changes.


```
Your three-tier application (frontend, backend, and database) has successfully built and started using Docker Compose. All services launched without critical errors, and the frontend is available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

You can now view and interact with your CI/CD Health Dashboard. If you need to test features, connect the frontend to backend APIs, or want to verify any specific functionality, let me know your next steps!

ANSHUKPANDEY: Verify the health of back-end, DB end and front-end in this setup.

GitHub Copilot: Here’s the health check summary for your three-tier setup:

- **Backend (FastAPI)**: The server started successfully and is running at `http://localhost:8000`. No critical errors in logs.
- **Database (PostgreSQL)**: The database started, accepted connections, and initialized the schema. However, the `psql` client is not installed in your dev container, so direct table listing could not be performed.
- **Frontend (React)**: The frontend compiled and started successfully, available at `http://localhost:3000`. No critical errors in logs.

All services are running and healthy based on container logs. For deeper DB inspection, you can install `psql` or use a database GUI. If you want to verify API connectivity or UI functionality, let me know!

ANSHUKPANDEY: Thanks !!
The three tier application is now up and running. All the pods are in running condition. But the web-application is facing below mentioned challanges-
1. The front-end container logs are having below message-

    at Axios.request (http://127.0.0.1:3000/static/js/bundle.js:1323:41) "

    Please check and resolve this issue.

    Note: The web-application should have URL which should fulfill all the conditions mentioned in the 'docs/requirement.md'. 

GitHub Copilot: Here’s what’s happening and how I’ll resolve it:

### Issues
1. **Frontend Container Logs**:  
   - The logs show a development build warning (not critical).
   - The main issue is `npm error signal SIGTERM`—the container is being stopped, likely due to a crash or misconfiguration.

2. **Web Page Error**:  
   - The frontend is making an API request (likely via Axios) and getting a 404 error.
   - This means the frontend is trying to reach a backend endpoint that does not exist or is misconfigured.

### Next Steps
1. **Check the API URLs used in the frontend** (`src/` and `components/`).
2. **Verify backend endpoints** match what the frontend expects (especially for metrics, builds, etc.).
3. **Ensure frontend is configured to call the backend at the correct address (`/api/...` or similar)**, and that CORS is set up in FastAPI.
4. **Switch frontend to production build for stability** (optional, but recommended).

I’ll start by searching for API calls in the frontend code to identify what endpoints are being requested and compare them to the backend routes. The root cause of your frontend 404 error is that Axios is making requests to `/metrics/summary` and `/builds`—these are relative URLs. In Docker, the frontend and backend run on different containers/ports, so the frontend tries to call its own container (not the backend), resulting in a 404.

### Solution
You need to update the frontend to call the backend using the correct base URL.  
**Best practice:** Use an environment variable (e.g., `REACT_APP_API_URL`) for the backend URL, and update Axios calls accordingly.

#### Steps:
1. Update Axios calls in App.js to use the backend URL from an environment variable.
2. Add `.env` file in frontend with `REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000` (for local dev).
3. Update Dockerfile to copy `.env` if needed.

Would you like me to make these changes automatically?

ANSHUKPANDEY: Please make the above suggested changes.

GitHub Copilot: Made changes.


```


Made changes.


```
The frontend is now configured to use the backend API URL via the environment variable, and Axios requests will correctly target the backend service. The containers have rebuilt and started successfully.

Next steps:
- Open the web application in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
- The dashboard should now fetch data from the backend without 404 errors.

If you still encounter issues or need further adjustments (such as production build, error handling, or additional features), let me know!

ANSHUKPANDEY: The web page is opening but it still having below mentioned error-

    Also we see below mentioned error in db logs- 
"db-1  | 2025-08-25 06:41:07.008 UTC [57] LOG:  invalid length of startup packet

db-1  | 2025-08-25 06:41:38.653 UTC [63] LOG:  invalid length of startup packet"

Please resolve this issue.

GitHub Copilot: Here’s what’s happening and how I’ll resolve it:

### 1. **Frontend 404 Error**
- The frontend is still getting a 404 from the backend for `/metrics/summary` and `/builds`.
- This is likely because the frontend is using `REACT_APP_API_URL=http://backend:8000`, but in your browser, `http://backend:8000` is not resolvable—your browser can only reach `http://localhost:8000`.

**Solution:**  
Set `REACT_APP_API_URL` to `http://localhost:8000` in `.env` so the frontend (in your browser) can reach the backend.

### 2. **DB "invalid length of startup packet"**
- These are usually caused by non-Postgres clients (like health checks or port scans) connecting to the DB port. They are not critical and can be ignored unless the DB is not working.

---

### I will:
1. Update `.env` to use `http://localhost:8000` for `REACT_APP_API_URL`.
2. Rebuild and restart the containers.

Let’s fix the `.env` and restart. 
```


Made changes.


```
The main issue was the frontend trying to reach the backend at a Docker-internal hostname (`backend:8000`), which is not accessible from your browser. This has now been corrected to `http://localhost:8000` in the `.env` file.

**What to do next:**
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
- The frontend should now successfully fetch data from the backend, and the 404 errors should be resolved.

**About the DB logs:**  
The "invalid length of startup packet" messages are not critical and are usually caused by non-Postgres clients or health checks. Your database is running and accepting connections.

If you still see errors on the web page, please let me know the exact message or behavior, and I’ll continue troubleshooting until the dashboard works as required.

ANSHUKPANDEY: We are still having the error in Dashboard. 
The error mentions below mentioned message- 
"  Uncaught runtime errors:
×
ERROR
Request failed with status code 404
AxiosError: Request failed with status code 404
    at settle (http://127.0.0.1:3000/static/js/bundle.js:2200:12)

    at Axios.request (http://127.0.0.1:3000/static/js/bundle.js:1323:41) "

GitHub Copilot: The persistent 404 error means the frontend is now correctly trying to reach the backend at `http://localhost:8000`, but the backend is not serving the expected endpoints (`/metrics/summary` and `/builds`) at the root path.

**Root Cause:**  
FastAPI backend endpoints are likely mounted at `/api/metrics/summary` and `/api/builds` (or similar), but the frontend is requesting `/metrics/summary` and `/builds`.

**Solution:**  
Update the frontend Axios calls in App.js to use the correct API paths, such as `/api/metrics/summary` and `/api/builds`.

I will inspect the backend route prefixes and update the frontend accordingly. Your backend endpoints are correctly mounted at `/metrics/summary` and `/builds` (not under `/api`).  
The frontend is also requesting these paths, so the URLs match.

**Possible causes for 404:**
- The backend is not reachable from the browser (container networking issue).
- The backend is not running or is crashing.
- The frontend is running in development mode and proxying requests incorrectly.

**Next steps:**
1. Check if you can access `http://localhost:8000/metrics/summary` and `http://localhost:8000/builds` directly in your browser or with `curl`.
2. If you get a 404, the backend is not serving these endpoints or is not running.
3. If you get a valid response, the issue is with frontend configuration or proxy.

Would you like me to run a health check on these backend endpoints to confirm their availability?

ANSHUKPANDEY: Yes. Please run the health check on the backend endpoints. 

GitHub Copilot: Health check results:

- `GET /metrics/summary`: Returns HTTP 200 OK and valid JSON. The backend endpoint is healthy and reachable.
- `GET /builds`: Returns HTTP 307 Temporary Redirect to `/builds/`. This means the backend expects a trailing slash (`/builds/`), and will redirect if not present.

**Action:**  
Update your frontend Axios call for builds to use `${API_URL}/builds/` (with trailing slash) to avoid the redirect and potential 404.

I will update your frontend code to fix this now. 
```


Made changes.


```
The frontend Axios call for `/builds` now uses the correct trailing slash, matching the backend route. The backend endpoint `/metrics/summary` is also healthy.

**Next steps:**
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
- The dashboard should now display data without 404 errors.

If you still see any errors, please share the exact message or behavior, and I’ll continue troubleshooting until the dashboard works as required.

ANSHUKPANDEY: On running docker compose ps command, I am getting below output- 

"WARN[0000] /workspaces/AI-Native-KRA-Assignment-2/docker-compose.yml: the attribute `version` is obsolete, it will be ignored, please remove it to avoid potential confusion"

GitHub Copilot: The warning about the `version` attribute in your docker-compose.yml is not critical and does not affect the running containers. Docker Compose v3.8 and above ignores the `version` field, and recommends removing it to avoid confusion.

**How to fix:**  
Simply delete the `version: '3.8'` line from the top of your docker-compose.yml file.

Would you like me to remove this line for you?
